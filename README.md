# Tajny Zapis

This is the backend for [Tajny Zapis](https://tajnyzapis.dev), a toy
project I made for the simple pleasure of designing and building a
software system.

Four years ago I began writing aws lambdas in javascript and then moved onto
typescript. With this project I learned to love writing lambdas in go.
It's very enjoyable. The code compiles into a single binary. With the js/ts
ecosystem I resorted to webpacking. The go approach is far superior.
No bundling system to tweak, compilation is a single easy command,
compilation is super fast, single binary, no runtime to bootstrap on warmup,
no jit delay.

## Design

I like to do this by hand, with paper and pen, and I don't want to take
pictures and upload them since I don't like the look of it. So you're going
to have to take my word for it that the design is drawn out. That being said,
when time and desire permit, I like to draw on the computer.

Here is the design of creating a tajny zapis (secret note).

Honestly, it is unlikely that I'll draw out the decrypt flow because making
pretty images for fun takes time, and my time is limited. But who knows,
perhaps one day you'll return and you'll find it here ðŸ˜‰

## Deploying

I have this in my `.zshrc` and it works well enough.
```
function deploy-tajny-zapis () {
  GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o dist/bootstrap main.go && \
  zip dist/lambda-handler.zip dist/bootstrap && \
  aws lambda update-function-code --function-name=tajny-zapis --zip-file fileb://dist/lambda-handler.zip
}
```

```
aws s3 sync frontend s3://tajnyzapis.dev
```

## Update April 2024
I haven't touched this project for several months. Reading through the encryption flow with a better understanding
of crypto, there a couple of minor improvements that can be done. I don't have the time to make changes, and this project
doesn't get any interest anyway.

Additionally, I designed this architecture after being in the cloud world for years. Now that I've been independent for
some time, I don't think a fragmented architecture is the best approach for this kind of application. I think a superior
approach is to run a dedicated server on OVHcloud, and make the whole application a self-contained go binary, using htmx
for the frontend and sqlite for storage. All hosted on an OpenBSD machine, properly pledge()'d and unveil()'d, behind relayd.
An app like this uses so little as far as server resources go that it can easily co-exist with other similarly made apps.
Backups can be scheduled with cron, encrypted and authenticated using standard openssl commands, scp'd to rsync.net.
Server redundancy can be achived with having an "additional" IP and re-routing it to the backup sever.
Depending on data needs, litestream can be used to ensure that the backup database is a fully ready clone of prod.
