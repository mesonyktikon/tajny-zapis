# Tajny Zapis

This is the backend for [Tajny Zapis](https://tajnyzapis.dev), a toy
project I made for the simple pleasure of designing and building a
software system.

Four years ago I began writing aws lambdas in javascript and then moved onto
typescript. With this project I learned to love writing lambdas in go.
It's very enjoyable. The code compiles into a single binary. With the js/ts
ecosystem I resorted to webpacking. The go approach is far superior.
No bundling system to tweak, compilation is a single easy command,
compilation is super fast, single binary, no runtime to bootstrap on warmup,
no jit delay.

## Design

I like to do this by hand, with paper and pen, and I don't want to take
pictures and upload them since I don't like the look of it. So you're going
to have to take my word for it that the design is drawn out. That being said,
when time and desire permit, I like to draw on the computer.

Here is the design of creating a tajny zapis (secret note).
